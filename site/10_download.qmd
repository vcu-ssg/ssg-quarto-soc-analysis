## Semesters of available data

The table below offers a summary of data available for analysis.  Refer to subsequent pages for
details on the data included for those analysis.

Additional semesters can be downloaded from the VCU Reporting Center per the instructions below.

```{python}
#| echo: false
import os
import pathlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from IPython.display import Markdown
from tabulate import tabulate
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

directory_path = './data'
file_list = os.listdir(directory_path)
xlsx_files = [file for file in file_list if file.endswith('.xlsx')]
xlsx_df = pd.DataFrame({'file_name':xlsx_files})

xlsx_df['term_code'] = xlsx_df['file_name'].str.split('-').str[2]

def convert_ay(term_code):
    year = term_code[2:4]
    return f'AY{int(year)-1}-{year}'

xlsx_df['academic_year'] = xlsx_df['term_code'].apply(convert_ay)

xlsx_df['period_code'] = xlsx_df['file_name'].str.split('-').str[3]
xlsx_df['period_code'] = xlsx_df['period_code'].str.split('.').str[0]

def convert_period(period_code):
    year = period_code[2:]
    period_id = period_code[:2]
    terms = {'FA': 'Fall', 'SP': 'Spring', 'SU': 'Summer'}
    period_name = terms.get(period_id, 'Unknown')
    return f'{period_name} {year}'

xlsx_df['period_name'] = xlsx_df['period_code'].apply(convert_period)

xlsx_df["file_name"] = "<a href='data/"+xlsx_df["file_name"]+"'>"+xlsx_df["file_name"]+"</a>"

Markdown(tabulate(
  xlsx_df, 
  headers=['File name','Term Code','Acad Year','Period Code','Period Name'],
  numalign="left",stralign="left",
  showindex=False
))

```

## Download additional data

Data were pulled from the VCU Reporting Center in the *Staff | Course Schedule Report* as shown below:

Reports are run by semester for the College of Engineering and stored in separate files.  Care should
be taken to open each file after it's been saved and **RESAVE** the file into XLSX format.

The files are named appropriately and stored in the [*data* folder in this repository.](https://github.com/vcu-ssg/ssg-quarto-soc-analysis/tree/main/site/data)

## Data Cleaning is Needed!

These data are difficult to work in separate files and often contain incorrect or inconsistent data.  A significant process of [data cleaning](20_clean.qmd) was undertaken prior to computing workloads.
