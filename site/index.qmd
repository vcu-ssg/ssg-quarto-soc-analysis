This web report presents an application of a sample model of faculty workload
over the past two semesters (Spring 2023 and Fall 2023).

This is intended to be a living analysis.  As additions and corrections are found please let me know and we can implement the necessary changes and re-render the report.

This report was developed using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), an open-source scientific and technical publishing designed with reproducibility in mind.  Analyses were performed using python.  The source code for the pages on this site are available in a [github repository](https://github.com/vcu-ssg/ssg-quarto-soc-analysis).

## Report organization

The site is organized as follow:

* [Download](./10_download.qmd) - this section describes the source of data (VCU reports) and shows the files and semesters downloaded.  This section is provided so that others can obtain the same data used for this report.

* [Clean](./20_clean.qmd) - this section documents the cleaning strategies applied to the data obtained above. This section refactors and reshapes the data, adds new columns and corrects known errors. The data
are stored in this repo, and are also uploaded to this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZK7k8M85CXLof6FdeJYJuGFbfjsOXrCv5mc7OgUInWw/edit#gid=1728987696).

* [Explore](./30_explore.qmd) - this section offers several sample analysis using the cleaned data. This report is generated using python and matplotlib. The examples are offered as demonstrations of the possible, not as part of a real analysis of workload.

## Rolling your own model

The resulting dataframe is [available here](stacked_df.csv) for download as CSV.

The result dataframe is also uploaded to a [google workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZK7k8M85CXLof6FdeJYJuGFbfjsOXrCv5mc7OgUInWw/edit#gid=1722375566
) and a sample analysis is conducted.

## Persistent data

The [banner report](10_download.qmd) used to create this report does not contain
all the necessary data to complete the analysis (e.g., instructor department).

Persistent data are stored in a google sheet.

[Instructor data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZK7k8M85CXLof6FdeJYJuGFbfjsOXrCv5mc7OgUInWw/edit#gid=654840116) - these data provide instructor departments and instructor roles, and an instructor
workload designation. This table is necessary for the analysis.

[Instructor notes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZK7k8M85CXLof6FdeJYJuGFbfjsOXrCv5mc7OgUInWw/edit#gid=211942472) - these data offer additional details about instructors.  It is expected that these data might be incorporated into a subsequent workload report. This table is optional to this analysis.

[Course notes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZK7k8M85CXLof6FdeJYJuGFbfjsOXrCv5mc7OgUInWw/edit#gid=498592034) - these data offer additional details about the courses. This table is optional to this analysis.
